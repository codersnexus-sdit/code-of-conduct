# Code of Conduct
## Coders Nexus SDIT – Open Source Community

At **Coders Nexus SDIT**, we believe that learning and collaboration go hand in hand.  
We are a growing community of developers, designers, and learners who share a common goal — to **learn by building**, **help each other grow**, and **create meaningful open-source projects** together.

This Code of Conduct is a reflection of our values and our shared responsibility to make Coders Nexus a space where everyone feels respected, inspired, and safe.

---

### 1. Value Everyone
We’re all here to learn, grow, and create.  
Treat every member — whether a beginner or expert — with appreciation, empathy, and encouragement.  
Acknowledge different perspectives, personal boundaries, and individual learning journeys.

---

### 2. Keep the Space Safe and Supportive
We don’t tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.  
Everyone should feel welcome, regardless of gender, background, religion, appearance, or skill level.  
If something feels uncomfortable or unsafe, reach out to a community lead immediately — we’ll listen and take it seriously.

---

### 3. Communicate with Purpose
Our conversations should add value — whether it’s helping someone debug code, sharing ideas, or discussing projects.  
Be clear, positive, and respectful in your tone.  
Avoid negativity, arguments, and unnecessary criticism. Constructive feedback only!

---

### 4. Collaborate Openly
Coders Nexus is built on teamwork and contribution.  
Share what you learn, ask for help when stuck, and appreciate others’ efforts.  
Open source isn’t just about code — it’s about community.

---

### 5. Learn and Let Learn
Everyone starts somewhere.  
If someone asks a basic question, help them out.  
If you know something new, share it.  
The goal is not to be perfect — it’s to progress together.

---

### 6. Keep It Clean and Relevant
This community is for learning, collaboration, and open-source growth.  
Avoid spamming, unrelated promotions, or self-advertising.  
If you’d like to share something external, check with the core team first.

---

### 7. Own Your Actions
Your behavior shapes the community’s culture.  
Be honest, accountable, and mindful of what you post or say.  
If you make a mistake — own it, apologize, and learn from it.

---

### 8. Consequences of Violations
If a member’s behavior goes against our values, the **Core Team** will review the situation fairly.  
Actions may include:  
- A private warning  
- Temporary removal from events or discussions  
- Permanent ban from the community (in serious cases)  

We aim for correction, not punishment — but the safety of our members always comes first.

---

### 9. Reaching Out
If you experience or witness any violation of this Code of Conduct, contact any Core Member or Faculty Coordinator immediately.  
All concerns will be handled confidentially and respectfully.


### Together, we build. Together, we grow.
